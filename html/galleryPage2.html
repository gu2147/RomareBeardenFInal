                    <p class="title">Cattle of the Sun God, </p>
                    <p class="medium-description">
                        Romare Bearden’s "Cattle of the Sun God" retells the myth of Odysseus’ men disobeying 
                        his orders and slaughtering the sacred cattle of Helios. The composition contrasts the 
                        sailors’ desperate hunger with the tranquil serenity of the sun god's prized herd. 
                        Bearden's layered collage technique, rich in color and texture, emphasizes the tension 
                        between greed and reverence. The sacre grounds of the cattle stand out against 
                        the dark forms of the crew, highlighting the spiritual violation that brings about 
                        their doom. By taking symbols from the African diaspora into this classical myth, 
                        Bearden reflects on the historical significance of sacred customs and 
                        the dire consequences of ignoring them.

                    <p class="medium-description">
                        In "Circe," Romare Bearden masterfully depicts the powerful sorceress who captivates Odysseus and 
                        his men. 
                        Circe’s commanding figure stands before an intricately layered backdrop of swirling  
                        oranges and reds. These colors, reminiscent of African textiles, reflect her mystical power. 
                        Her pose, both alluring and authoritative, captures her ability to captivate Odysseus and his men. 
                        African motifs and symbols are integrated into the composition, 
                        transforming the classical sorceress into a representation of enduring strength and cultural identity. 
                        The intricate layering of textures and abstract forms creates a dreamlike realm, 
                        emphasizing the timeless nature of Circe’s spell and her role as both protector and potential 
                        threat to Odysseus’ journey.
