                This page features the references and research I did to complete the project. This page is longer and 
                scrollable unlike the other pages, due to the amount of content it features. Thank you for viewing my website and 
                I hope you enjoyed it!
                <br><br>

                To find the source code I uploaded all of the files onto a github repository: <a href="https://github.com/gu2147/RomareBeardenFInal.git"> https://github.com/gu2147/RomareBeardenFInal.git</a>
                
                <br><br>
                To find the tutorials they are linked in this google doc:<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsj2QuEfiKXOV4jsKowoM8dnO-7djCagkpbbezaGzQk/edit?usp=sharing" class="link"> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsj2QuEfiKXOV4jsKowoM8dnO-7djCagkpbbezaGzQk/edit?usp=sharing</a>
                <br><br>
                As per developer.mozilla.org "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to 
                structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within 
                a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables." 
                <br>    
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to style the elements of your html code and Javascript 
                allows you to create dynamic content on your website. 
                <br><br>
                I watched many HTML, CSS, and Javascript tutorials on Youtube to help teach me the basics.
                From those tutorials I came up with a lot of mock up websites until I landed on a layout that I 
                felt like was both educational and interactive. 
                <br><br>
                I modeled this website after Opportunity, a journal dedicated to giving a platform to African
                American artists and writers. These are the reference images I used :
                <br><br>
            </p>
               <img src="Cover-page.-Opportunity.-Feb-1941.jpg" alt="">
               <img src="IMG_0875.HEIC" alt="">
               <img src="IMG_0876.HEIC" alt="">
            <p class="about-Description">
                <br><br>
                The idea for the layout came to me after visiting the Harlem Renaissance exhibit
                at the MET Museum. Opportunity was featured in the exhibit and I really liked the 
                graphic design of the covers, so I decided to make it into a website. 

                <br><br>
                Things I learned: 
                <br><br>
                * Making a website is challenging (no duh Gabby). 
                I knew this going into the project, but I spent a lot more time formatting the layout of the 
                website rather than the dynamic elements. The home page took me the longest time to complete
                which came to my surprise, as I thought the canvas page would've taken the longest. 
                <br><br>
                * I also learned that this was something I really enjoyed doing and I will definetly spend more 
                time learning more web development tools in the future.
                <br><br>

                Things That Didn't Make the Cut:
                <br><br>
                * Unfortunetly, many events took place on campus after I announced the idea. I do have code for making 
                a rectangle select tool, however, it was too buggy for my liking and I didn't feel like it was fair to 
                submit something that may or may not have worked. Instead of a select tool, there is an image "brush" like tool
                that works similarly to how the Shapes tools work. You can select any of the images to use and adjust the 
                size of the image, giving more of a stamp feel. 

                <br><br>
                * The UNDO button. This button suffered the same fate as the select tool so I opted out of featuring it in the final website.
                Instead, there is a clear all button and this forces the user to embrace any mistakes. You can erase images (which is sort of a 
                work around "undo") and I felt like the frustration of incorrectly pasting an image would be similar to when Bearden would make mistakes
                on his board. 

                <br><br>
                Future Plans:
                <br><br> 
                * I do plan on adding these features! For the sake of time and deadlines that Professor Harris-Kelley also has, this is the "final"
                that I am handing in. However, I am very close to getting the rectangle select tool to be functional, so I will be spending time on this
                project from now until June. The URL won't be updated because I do not want to update in the middle of Prof. Harris-Kelley viewing, so only the 
                github repo will be updated. 
                <br><br>
                * I will also be changing the UI of the canvas page. It is the only page that is out of theme and I would love to 
                show it in a way that fits the theme more cohesively. 
                <br><br>
                * Minor adjustments to the UI is also something that I am looking into, just to make the pages more static so they feel like flipping 
                through a magazine. 

                <br><br>
                Overall, I really enjoyed the class and learning about Bearden and his work. He loved to step outside his comfort zone, try new
                techniques, and was dedicated to making a message out of his art. I hope that my website honors his creative vision and I can't 
                wait to keep updating!
